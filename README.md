# Path-Of-Oil
Path Of Oil was created to solve a minor inconvenience for myself, Allowing me to see the oils on Anointed drops from Blight Encounters to determine what I want to use my Extractors on (personally only things containing Black and Higher oils no lower oils)

# See the port, I approve of this project
